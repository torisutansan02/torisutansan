If used as an instrument or a medium, it exists in this form rather than what it truly is.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A superfluous effort to reshape the Absolute again changes its form. The counteracting of this superfluous effort is its negation, leading us to back where we were.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Knowledge limits us to a field of expertise where we slice and dice the ultimate dialectical reality. But it is merely a piece to the puzzle and not solving the entire puzzle itself.</p>",
