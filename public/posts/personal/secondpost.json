There is going to be a list of things I plan on doing while on my vacation here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organizing Sakurabu activities.</li>\n<li>Seeing Christmas lights.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I miss living in Riverside and attending college classes. However, I think my fall quarter was quite difficult. I fell behind in many of my classes, however, I am giving myself time to rethink my studying habits. I am going into the winter quarter with a different mindset.</p>\n<p>There is not much to say or do. My brother has a cute cat whose name is Puff. My grandfather gave my brother the cat, and I think my brother is doing a great job taking care of him. Especially since my brother works full time.</p>",
