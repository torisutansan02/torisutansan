When I get better with databases, I want to use MongoDB. Every paragraph in my blog is going to have four to five sentences. Enough to explain my\r\nthoughts but not excessive.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this serves as an opportunity for you to learn more about me. Today, I am making a smoothie. I think the ingredients I use themselves\r\ndo not taste very good. But in combination, I think they are delicious.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spinach</li>\n<li>Bananas</li>\n<li>Chia Seeds</li>\n<li>Matcha</li>\n<li>Almond Milk</li>\n<li>Tropical fruit blend (Mangoes, strawberries).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You might want to try this recipe yourself. I use a variety of different ingredients each day for my smoothies. Please take my advice and use different ingredients for smoothies everyday! Variety makes everything more fun and flavorful!</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>First Column</th>\n<th>Second Column</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Test Case 1</td>\n<td>Test Case 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Test Case 2</td>\n<td>Test Case 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Test Case 3</td>\n<td>Test Case 3</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
