This is my first blog I am posting to my website. Today, I am trying to learn dynamic routing to post these cute little blogs on my website. When I get better with databases, I want to use MongoDB.

Hopefully this serves as an opportunity for you to learn more about me. You are all wonderful and today I made a smoothie.

Some of the ingredients I use are:

- Spinach
- Bananas
- Chia Seeds
- Matcha
- Almond Milk
- Tropical fruit blend (Mangoes, strawberries).

You might want to try this recipe yourself. If so, please take my advice and use different ingredients for smoothies everyday! Variety makes everything more fun and flavorful!
