This is my first blog I am posting to my website. Today, I am trying to learn dynamic routing to post these cute little blogs on my website. When I get better with databases, I want to use MongoDB. Every paragraph in my blog is going to have four to five sentences. Enough to explain my
thoughts but not excessive.

Hopefully this serves as an opportunity for you to learn more about me. Today, I am making a smoothie. I think the ingredients I use themselves
do not taste very good. But in combination, I think they are delicious.

- Spinach
- Bananas
- Chia Seeds
- Matcha
- Almond Milk
- Tropical fruit blend (Mangoes, strawberries).

You might want to try this recipe yourself. I use a variety of different ingredients each day for my smoothies. Please take my advice and use different ingredients for smoothies everyday! Variety makes everything more fun and flavorful!
