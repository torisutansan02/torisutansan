What is a two sum array?

Imagine a list of 4 elements.
- The target value of the list is equal to 4.
- The list has 2, 1, 5, 3 as array indices.

To solve this problem with brute force:
- On the first index, check if proceeding values equal to 4.
- 2 + 1 = 3.
- 2 + 5 = 7.
- 2 + 3 = 5.

Now, the next index.
- 1 + 5 = 6.
- 1 + 3 = 4.

We have found our match through brute force.

The runtime for this algorithm is O(n^2).
- Two nested for loops.

Let's solve this using a hash map.
- Index of 0 is 2.
- Index of 1 is 1.
- Index of 2 is 5.
- Index of 3 is 3.

HashMap:
- Val : Index.
- 2 : 0.
- 1 : 1.
- 5 : 2.
- 3 : 3.
- 4 - 3 exists on the hash map.
- Return [1, 3].

Only iterating through the array once.
- Time: O(n).
- Memory: O(n).
