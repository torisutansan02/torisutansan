## Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7] might become [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]).

You are given a target value to search. If you find the value in the array, return its index. Else, return -1.

Assume no duplicate exists in the array.
- Algorithm complexity must be in the runtime O(log(n)).

### Examples
- Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], target = 0.
- Output: 4.

- Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], target = 3.
- Output: -1.

### Binary Search
Imagine we have two linear lines in a graph.
- 0, 1, 2.
- 4, 5, 6, 7.
Two independently sorted arrays.
- Left Pointer, Middle Pointer, and Right Pointer.
- Left <= Right.
- Middle value is 6.
- Let's say our target value is 0.
- 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2.
- Middle pointer is 7, left pointer is 4, and right pointer is 2.
- 0 is less than 7, the middle pointer, and 0 is also less than 4, the left pointer.
- Get rid of 4, 5, 6, 7.
- Left with 0, 1, 2.
- Eliminate 1 and 2, the new middle and right pointers.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1

        # [1]
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if target == nums[mid]:
                return mid

            # left sorted portion
            if nums[l] <= nums[mid]:
                if target > nums[mid] or target < nums[l]:
                    l = mid + 1
                else:
                    r = mid - 1
            # right sorted portion
            else:
                if target < nums[mid] or target > nums[r]:
                    r = mid - 1
                else:
                    l = mid + 1

        return -1
```

## 3Sum
Given an array nums of n integers, are there 3 elements a, b, and c in nums where a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
- Note:
- The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

### Example
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, 4],
- A solution set is:
- [
-     [-1, 0, 1],
-     [-1, -1, 2]
- ]

### Concept
Let's say we have an array [-3, 3, 4, -3, 1, 2].
- a + b + c must = 0.
- -3 + 1 + 2.
- This is a brute force case where:
- a = -3, b = 3, 4, -3, 1, c = 2.
- Three for loops and highly inefficient.
- We are not allowed to find duplicates.

### Sort Input Array
Sort the input array.
- [-3, -3, 1, 2, 3, 4].
- If we find a number, ignore it!
- [-3, 1, 2].
- -3 + 1 + 2 = 0.
- Reduces it to Two Sum.

### Left and Right Pointer
- Left pointer is -3 and right pointer is 4.
- If sum > 0, shift right pointer left.
- Right pointer is no longer 4, it is 3.
- If sum < 0, shift right pointer right.
- Shift if there is a duplicate.
- Time: O(nlog(n)) + O(n^2).
- Time: O(n^2).
- Space: O(1) or O(n) depending on sorting library.
