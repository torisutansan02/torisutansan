## Concept
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7] might become [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]).

You are given a target value to search. If you find the value in the array, return its index. Else, return -1.

Assume no duplicate exists in the array.
- Algorithm complexity must be in the runtime O(log(n)).

### Examples
- Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], target = 0.
- Output: 4.

- Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], target = 3.
- Output: -1.

### Binary Search
Imagine we have two linear lines in a graph.
- 0, 1, 2.
- 4, 5, 6, 7.
Two independently sorted arrays.
- Left Pointer, Middle Pointer, and Right Pointer.
- Left <= Right.
- Middle value is 6.
- Let's say our target value is 0.
- 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2.
- Middle pointer is 7, left pointer is 4, and right pointer is 2.
- 0 is less than 7, the middle pointer, and 0 is also less than 4, the left pointer.
- Get rid of 4, 5, 6, 7.
- Left with 0, 1, 2.
- Eliminate 1 and 2, the new middle and right pointers.
