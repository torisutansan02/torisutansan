## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (LeetCode)
You have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
Buy one day and sell one day.

### Example 1:
- Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4].
- Output: 5.
- Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 - 1 = 5. Not 7 - 1 = 6. Selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

### Concept:
Take the minimum value and maximum value. Subtract the maximum value from the minimum. However, time moves in one direction. You must buy before selling.

### Two Pointers:
Left point and right pointer.
- L = Buy.
- R = Sell.
- Left pointer = 1.
- Right pointer = 6.
- Max profit = 5.
- Memory: O(1).
- Time: O(n).

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, 1 # left = buying and right = selling
        maxP = 0

        while r < len(prices):
            #profitable or not?
            if prices[l] < prices[r]:
                profit = prices[r] - prices[l]
                maxP = max(maxP, profit)
            else:
                l = r
            r += 1

        return maxP
```

## Contains Duplicates
Given an integery array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array. Else return false if every element is distinct.

### Examples
- Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1].
- Output: true.

- Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4].
- Output: false.

- Input: nums = [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2].
- Output: true.

### Concept
Check if every number after i is a duplicate.
- Time: O(n^2).
- Space: O(1).

### Sorting Algorithm
Compare two neighbors in the array.
- Time: O(nlogn).
- Space: O(1).

### HashSet
Insert elements into HashSet with O(1) time.
Does a certain value exist in the hash map?
- HashSet: 1, 2, 3.
- Return True.
- Time: O(n).
- Space: O(n).
