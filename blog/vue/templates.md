# Vue Templates

The HTML part of a Vue application.

We use the template tag in *.vue files.

You can use template as a configuration option in a Vue instance.
- And put HTML inside.

```html
```

## Single File Components (SFCs)

It is best to write Vue code in SFCs, or *.vue files.

It consists of three parts:
- A template tag with HTML content.
- A script tag with Vue code.
- A style tag where we write CSS styling.
