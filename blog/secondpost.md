I am making a second blog post. Currently, I am in Northern California. Spending the Christmas season with my brother.

A couple of things I am going to do here:

- Organizing Sakurabu activities.
- Seeing Christmas lights.

I miss Riverside and college. Northern California is very boring. However, I think this gives me a great opportunity
to relax and enjoy my break.
