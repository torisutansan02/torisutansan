## Container With Most Water
Given n non-negative
$$
a_{1}
a_{2}
a_{n}
$$
where each represents a point at the coordinates
$$
(i, a_{i})
$$
n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i
$$
(i, a_{i})
and
(i, 0).
$$
Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most amount of possible water.

### Example
- Input: height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 3, 7].
- Output: 49.
- Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by the array [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]. In this case, the max water is 49.

### Brute Force Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        # Brute Force
        res = 0
        for l in range(len(height)):
            for r in range(l + 1, len(height)):
                area = (r - l) * min(height[l], height[r])
                res = max(res, area)
            return res
```
This brute force code is far too slow.

### Optimal Solution
- Set the left pointer to the far left.
- Set the right pointer to the far right.
- Think of the max area as a box from the left to the right representing width and the minimum height of the left and right pointers.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        while l < r:
            area = (r - l) * min(height[l], height[r])
            res = max(res, area)
            if (height[l] < height[r]):
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        return res
```

This solution has an O(n) runtime.
