# What is RAM?

We want to store data structures in a computer component called random access memory.
- Referred to as $RAM$ for short.

Arrays are ordered and contiguous.
- $[1, 2, 3]$
- Understood in $bits$ (1s and 0s).

## Bytes and Bits

One single $byte$ is made up of 8 bits.
- In the modern day, we think in $gigabytes$ $(GB)$ and $terrabytes$ $(TB)$

The most common data type, the $integer$ is stored in 4 bytes:
- 32 bits of memory.


## Addresses and Values

For each data type, a $address$ and a $value$ are assigned.
- An address is a distinct location in memory.
- A value represents the data type.

The value can be of any data type.
- A $string$, for example.
    - Or an $array$
    - Or a $boolean$
    - Any other data type.

Integers and strings are separated by 4 bytes, or 32 bits:
- Address denoted with a $ sign.
    - Followed by the amount of bytes.
