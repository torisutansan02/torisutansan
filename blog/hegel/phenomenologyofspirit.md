# Phenomenology of Spirit

Written by Georg Hegel.

George Hegel was a German philosopher whose background stems in Germain idealism and 19th-century philosophy.

- Focused on metaphysical issues in epistemology, ontology, political philosophy, et cetera.

## Introduction

What is the Absolute?

- The Absolute is the all-encompassing reality of what exists in the finite and infinite world.
    - The "Spirit" of being, whose self-consciousness is actualized.

Cognition is the medium which one discovers or attains self-consciousness.

- But there are different types of cognition.

Without a more definitive definition of cognition, its alignment towards the Absolute is unclear.

- Cognition is an instrument which shapes and foments the Absolute, but not waht the Absolute is in and of itself.

Making use of a means to the truth is meaningless. If used as an instrument or a medium, it exists in this form rather than what it truly is.

- A superfluous effort to reshape the Absolute again changes its form. The counteracting of this superfluous effort is its negation, leading us to back where we were.

Knowledge limits us to a field of expertise where we slice and dice the ultimate dialectical reality. But it is merely a piece to the puzzle and not solving the entire puzzle itself.
